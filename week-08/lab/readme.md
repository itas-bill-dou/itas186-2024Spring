# Lab 08: PHP Task List Session and Cookie

## Submission and deadline

No formal submission required. Please demonstrate your completed work to me directly.

## Instruction

1. Copy project `task-project-auth` into lab08 in php82.local folder.
2. Read flashMessage.php and understand the logic.
3. Use the flashMessage to replace all plain message. We need to leverage the flashMessage to improve the application with better user experience. We need to display a message at the top of page whenever we need to display an alert/notification.
